1. Lock the Visual Direction (Moodboard) — HIGH PRIORITY

Before generating any UI or assets, we must freeze:

🎨 Color Palette

Should reflect Lumore’s direction → pastel + iridescent glow

4–5 primary colors + 2 neutrals

Dark mode or not?

🔤 Typography Scale

Heading font → Playfair Display or Cormorant

Body → Inter / Söhne style

Line-height & spacing rules

🖼️ Styling Language

Soft shadows / glassmorphism / minimalism

Border radii system

Icon style (outline, pastel-filled, gradient)

✨ Motion Language

Parallax?

Glow-pulse CTAs?

Scroll-based fade-ins?

📌 Why this step is essential
If we don’t freeze the visual direction now, you will end up regenerating UI assets, product mockups, and hero videos multiple times.
This step saves 50% effort later.

2. Generate AI Product Mockups for All SKUs

We finalized the Lumore SKUs inspired by d’you.
Now we must create:

🧴 1 base 3D bottle/tube model per product

Cleanser = balm jar

Serum = transparent bottle with pipette

Moisturizer = pump bottle

Sunscreen = soft-touch tube

Lip balm = stick

Eye patches = metallic pouch

Toner = frosted spray bottle

🔁 For each product, generate:

Front view

Angled view

Top-down view

Texture close-up

Shadow variants

Transparent PNG + mockups on real backgrounds

📌 These will be used everywhere:

Hero section

Product grid

Routines

Testimonials

Category cards

Combos

3. Generate Lifestyle Model Assets

We need two consistent models who appear throughout the demo site.

Requirements:

1 female, 1 male

Mid-20s

Dermatologically clean aesthetic

Calm, soft facial expression

Lighting consistent across shots

Skin-focus close-ups

“Routine” videos (washing, applying, spritzing)

Shot list:

Portrait

Half-body

Shower/bathroom aesthetic

Swatch on hand / cheek

Applying sunscreen, serum

Holding product bottle

Outdoor sunlight glow shot

These images decide 60% of brand identity.

4. Generate Hero Video (AI Short Loop)

This is the signature moment of your demo — it must stand out more than d’you.

Two hero video options:
Option A — Floating Product + Flower Field (d’you-like but better)

Sunscreen bottle rotating

Petals floating

Soft bokeh

Iridescent lighting

Option B — Water Glow Cinematic

Droplet explosion

Bottle rising from water

Light scattering

Slow-motion loop

Use Monobanana-style AI video generation to elevate to a luxury feel.

5. Write Brand Copy (Short Form)

You should prepare:

Homepage Microcopy:

Hero headline (3 options)

Sub-headline

CTA

6 value props

Category descriptions

Product card descriptions

Routine instruction copy

Tone Style:

Minimal

Soft

Confident

Science-forward

Example:

“Powered by active science. Designed for radiant skin.”

6. Create the High-Fidelity Landing Page Design

Using:

Finalized palette

Finalized typography

Finalized product shots

Finalized hero video

Finalized icons and motions

You now build the real UI in Figma or similar.

Order of UI design:

Hero

Product section

Ingredient block

Lifestyle models “Real Routines”

Category cards

Press + trust bar

Testimonials

Footer

7. Build the Demo in Next.js (Optional for Client Demo)

Once the visual design is approved, create:

Static Next.js landing page

Animations using Framer Motion

Responsive layout

Mobile-first PWA feel
