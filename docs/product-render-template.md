# 📦 MASTER PRODUCT RENDER TEMPLATE — UPDATED FOR LUXURY APPEAL  
_For Lumore — “Radiance, Redefined.”_

---

## 1. PRODUCT NAME  
**[Replace with SKU Name]**  
Example: *Lumore Solarveil™ SPF 50+*

## 2. PRODUCT CATEGORY  
(Sunscreen / Moisturizer / Serum / Toner / Lip Balm / Eye Cream)

---

## 3. MASTER RENDER REQUIREMENTS  
**Purpose:** Create ultra-clean base assets (green screen) that convey luxury material potential but remain visually neutral for compositing.

### ✔ Background  
- Pure chroma green screen: `#00FF00`  
- No shadows, no reflections, no separate light sources visible  
- Neutral rendering so texture/finish can be layered later  

### ✔ Material & Finish Insight  
- Choose materials aligned with luxury packaging trends:
  - Frosted glass for serums/toners  
  - Soft-touch matte plastic or glass for moisturizers/sunscreens  
  - Metal or heavy-weight finish for premium packaging cues  
  - Materials emphasising weight, tactility and luxury. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Colour on master renders: neutral (off-white or barely tinted) to allow flexibility.

### ✔ Lighting & Shadows  
- Flat illumination (studio white)  
- No dramatic directional lighting (eliminates harsh shadows)  
- No drop shadows (so you can add shadows later for realism)  
- No yin-yang reflections or strong glare (luxury look comes from material, not “flash”)  

### ✔ Composition  
- Product centered in frame  
- Camera focussed exactly on product (no props)  
- All angles have same field of view to maintain consistency across SKUs  
- High resolution (suggest at least 2048×2048px)  

---

## 4. ANGLES REQUIRED  
Generate each of the following views:

- Front view (primary)  
- 45° angle left  
- 45° angle right  
- Side view (profile)  
- Top-down view  
- (Optional) Cap-off view if applicable  
- (Optional) Lying-flat view for jar/balm  

---

## 5. PACKAGING SPECIFICATIONS  
Define for each SKU:

- **Shape:** (Cylinder / Tube / Jar / Bottle with dropper)  
- **Material:** (e.g., Frosted glass, Soft-touch matte plastic)  
- **Base Colour (neutral):** `#F4F4F4` (example)  
- **Cap/Detail Colour (neutral):** `#E0E0E0` (example)  
- **Logo Placement:** Center front, minimal fuss  
- **Finish Cues:** Embossing, foil stamping, subtle metallic accents (optional for future layering) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 6. FILE NAMING & EXPORT  
/lumore/products/[sku]/
sku-front.png
sku-45deg-left.png
sku-45deg-right.png
sku-side.png
sku-top.png
sku-capoff.png (if applicable)

- PNG format with transparency (after chroma keying)  
- Resolution: recommended 2048×2048 or higher

## 7. FUTURE USAGE NOTES  
- These master renders will serve as the basis for:
  - Homepage hero components  
  - Animated reels & product loops  
  - Lifestyle composites with models and backgrounds  
  - Theme-variant product cards across all four brand directions  
- Because all renders are neutral and clean, you maintain maximum flexibility for later high-end layering, finishing, and brand presentation.  
- Current industry research emphasises minimalism, high-quality materials, tactile finishes and reuse of assets across formats. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### ✅ Summary  
- **Master renders = neutral, clean, future-proof assets**  
- **Luxury cues (material, finish, weight) built into spec**  
- **No aesthetic effect yet – those come later in compositing**  
- **Consistent angles + naming for modelling efficiency**
