# Lumore - Easy Homepage Assets (Generate First)

**Purpose:** Simple assets that don't require models, products, or complex scenes
**Total Assets:** 8 images
**Difficulty:** Easy - No model references needed, straightforward prompts
**Priority:** Generate these first before Real Routines lifestyle shots

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: TEXT OVERLAY STRATEGY**

**NEW APPROACH:** Generate **CLEAN IMAGERY ONLY** - NO text generation in AI images!

**Why:**
- ✅ Gemini struggles with accurate text/typography (gibberish text issue)
- ✅ HTML/CSS overlays give perfect control over text, fonts, sizing
- ✅ Fully editable - change headlines without regenerating images
- ✅ Responsive - text adapts to screen sizes
- ✅ SEO-friendly - text is crawlable HTML, not image pixels

**What to Generate:**
- Clean product photography on pure white backgrounds
- Generous negative space for text placement
- NO magazine logos, headlines, award badges, or typography
- Ultra-minimal aesthetic

**What to Add via Code:**
- All text (magazine names, headlines, dates, award badges)
- Typography using Playfair Display + Inter fonts
- Responsive text overlays with CSS
- Award seals as SVG graphics

**Size Accuracy is CRITICAL:**
- 15ml products (small jars/tubes) must look NOTICEABLY smaller
- 30ml bottles should be clearly smaller than 50ml
- 50ml bottles are medium height
- 100ml bottles/jars are largest
- Proportions must match real product sizes
