### **✍️ STEP 2: Image Generation Prompt for Google Gemini**

**Copy this prompt and use WITH your reference images:**

```
[ATTACH YOUR REFERENCE IMAGE(S) FIRST]

Create a 3D rendered scene matching the exact style, lighting, and aesthetic of the attached reference image.

SCENE DESCRIPTION:
A dreamlike claw machine arcade game with Lumore's brand colors (iridescent lilac #E5D4F7, ocean blue #B8D4E8, soft mint #D4E8DD, pearl white #FAFAFA). The machine has a transparent glass case with "LUMORE" or "GRAB THE DEAL" glowing sign on top in iridescent lettering.

PRODUCTS INSIDE (Use ALL THREE):
Inside the machine, show THREE distinct Lumore products in their actual bottled packaging with consistent branding:

1. SOLAR VEIL - Coral/orange colored bottle (#FFE5CC) with metallic coral cap, SPF 50 sunscreen
2. DEW DROPS - Ocean blue colored bottle (#B8D4E8) with metallic cap, hydrating serum
3. LUMISKIN - Sage green colored bottle (#C5D8BE) with metallic cap, brightening cream

Each product should have:
- Clear, consistent bottle design (cylindrical luxury bottles)
- Metallic/chrome caps in coordinating colors
- "LUMORE" branding visible on labels
- Frosted glass texture
- Luxury skincare aesthetic

THE "MALFUNCTION" MOMENT:
The mechanical claw is positioned mid-grab, hilariously "malfunctioning" - gripping ALL THREE products at once (or 2-3 bottles) instead of just one, with products tumbling and falling in a joyful cascade. Some bottles are suspended in the claw's grip at different angles, creating dynamic composition. 1-2 bottles may already be in the prize chute below.

ENVIRONMENT & STYLE:
Match the background, lighting, and overall aesthetic from the reference image exactly. Incorporate Lumore's brand colors into the scene naturally. Include small sparkles and light particles floating around the machine. The scene should feel luxurious, playful, and surreal.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Ultra-detailed, photorealistic 3D render
- Luxury beauty commercial aesthetic
- Cinematic lighting with soft shadows
- Sharp focus on the claw mechanism and products
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape)
- High resolution (at least 1920x1080)

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Iridescent lilac #E5D4F7
- Secondary: Ocean blue #B8D4E8
- Accent: Soft mint #D4E8DD
- Base: Pearl white #FAFAFA
- Product colors: Orange #FFE5CC, Blue #B8D4E8, Green #C5D8BE

MOOD: Luxurious, playful, magical, exciting - like winning the jackpot at a beauty arcade

IMPORTANT: Match the style, composition, and aesthetic of the reference image exactly while incorporating these Lumore-specific elements.
```

### **Alternative Shorter Prompt (with reference):**

```
[ATTACH REFERENCE IMAGE]

Create in the exact style of the attached reference: 3D rendered claw machine with Lumore branding, filled with three luxury skincare bottles (Solar Veil orange #FFE5CC, Dew Drops blue #B8D4E8, Lumiskin green #C5D8BE), mechanical claw gripping all three products at once in playful "malfunction", products tumbling dramatically. Use Lumore colors: iridescent lilac #E5D4F7, ocean blue #B8D4E8, soft mint #D4E8DD, pearl white. Dreamy, luxurious beauty commercial aesthetic. Photorealistic CGI, cinematic lighting. Aspect ratio 16:9.
```

---

### **🎬 STEP 3: Image-to-Video Prompt for Google Veo**

**After generating the still image, use this prompt to create video:**

```
[USE THE GENERATED IMAGE AS INPUT]

Create a video animation from this image with the following motion:

CAMERA MOVEMENT:
Slow, smooth dolly push-in toward the claw machine over 5 seconds. Start with a wide shot showing the full scene, end with a medium shot focused on the claw mechanism and products. Add a subtle upward tilt as you push in.

CLAW MECHANISM MOTION:
- 0-1 second: Claw descends smoothly toward the products
- 1-2 seconds: Claw "malfunctions" and grabs all three Lumore products at once (Solar Veil, Dew Drops, Lumiskin)
- 2-3.5 seconds: Claw lifts up with all three products gripping awkwardly at different angles, products dangling and wobbling
- 3.5-5 seconds: Products tumble and fall into the prize chute in a joyful cascade

PRODUCT PHYSICS:
All three bottles should have realistic physics-based movement - slight rotation, tumbling, bouncing as they fall. Motion should feel playful and dynamic.

ENVIRONMENT MOTION:
Background elements gently drift and float with soft parallax movement. Small sparkle particles drift downward throughout the scene.

LIGHTING:
Subtle pulsing glow from the "LUMORE" sign. Gentle lighting changes as products move through different areas of the machine.

TECHNICAL SETTINGS:
- Duration: 5 seconds
- Motion: Smooth, professional, dreamlike (not too fast)
- Camera motion: Slow dolly in + subtle upward tilt
- Add medium motion blur for realism
- Maintain consistent lighting and style from the still image

MOOD: Playful, exciting, magical - capturing the joy of winning multiple products at once

Keep the aesthetic, colors, and style exactly matching the input image.

```

---

### **🎬 STEP 3: Image-to-Video Prompt for Google Veo**

**After generating the still image, use this prompt to create video:**

```
[USE THE GENERATED IMAGE AS INPUT]

Create a video animation from this image showing the Solar Veil production process:

CAMERA MOVEMENT:
Slow, smooth dolly move following the product journey from back to front over 6 seconds. Start at Level 1 (ingredient mixing) in the background, smoothly move forward through the production line, ending focused on the hero Solar Veil product at Level 3 (release) in the foreground. Add a subtle downward tilt as you move forward.

CONVEYOR BELT MOTION:
All three levels continuously moving at different speeds to show progression:
- Level 1 (ingredient mixing): Slowest movement
- Level 2 (label printing): Medium speed
- Level 3 (release): Fastest movement
This creates a sense of increasing completion/urgency.

PRODUCT MOVEMENT:
- Level 1: Solar Veil bottles rolling/rotating gently as they move along the belt
- Level 2: Bottles held stationary in fixtures while robotic arms apply labels with quick, precise movements
- Level 3: Bottles sliding down the final ramp smoothly, slight bounce/settle as they reach the end

HOLOGRAPHIC TEXT:
Ingredient labels ("VITAMIN C", "NIACINAMIDE", "ZINC OXIDE", "HYALURONIC ACID") gently pulse and glow on Level 1 during 0-2 seconds, then gradually fade as camera moves past them.

ROBOTIC ARMS (Level 2):
Precise, mechanical movements - extend toward bottle, apply label, retract smoothly. Full cycle takes 1-2 seconds. Show at least one complete label application cycle.

LIGHTING & EFFECTS:
LED indicators blink in sequence (green/blue colors). Gentle pulsing from overhead lights in Lumore brand colors. Subtle reflections on chrome surfaces and glass bottles.

FOCUS:
Start with everything in relatively equal focus. As camera moves forward, gradually shift focus so the hero Solar Veil product in the foreground becomes razor sharp while background softens slightly (rack focus effect).

TECHNICAL SETTINGS:
- Duration: 6 seconds
- Motion: Smooth, professional, industrial yet graceful
- Camera: Dolly forward + subtle downward tilt
- Add light motion blur on moving bottles
- Maintain consistent lighting and style from the input image

MOOD: Scientific precision, clean manufacturing, trustworthy quality, premium luxury production. Should feel like a high-end beauty brand factory tour.

Keep the aesthetic, colors, and style exactly matching the input image.

## 💡 Tips for Google Gemini Generation

### Image Generation (Gemini with Imagen 3):
- **Always attach reference images first** before submitting the prompt
- **Add explicit instruction:** "Match the exact style of the attached reference"
- **Be very specific** about Lumore branding, colors, and product details
- **Use exact hex codes** for colors in the prompt
- **Specify materials:** "frosted glass", "chrome metallic", "iridescent finish"
- **Mention lighting explicitly:** "soft ambient glow", "spot lighting", "rim lighting"
- **Request high resolution:** "1920x1080 minimum" or "high resolution render"
- **Aspect ratio:** Specify "16:9 landscape format"

### Getting Better Results:
- If first generation doesn't match reference well, add: "Follow the reference composition more closely"
- If colors are off, restate: "Use ONLY these Lumore brand colors: lilac #E5D4F7, ocean blue #B8D4E8, mint #D4E8DD, pearl white #FAFAFA"
- If products aren't clear, add: "All products must have visible 'LUMORE' branding and clear bottle shapes"
- Try generating 2-3 variations and pick the best one
- Use "photorealistic 3D render" and "luxury beauty commercial aesthetic" for style

### Video Generation (Google Veo):
- **Use the generated still image as input** for the video
- **Keep motion descriptions clear** and separate camera from object motion
- **Specify timing:** When each action happens in the 5-6 second duration
- **Request smooth motion:** "Professional, smooth, cinematic motion"
- **Avoid complex movements:** Focus on 1-2 primary motions
- **Request motion blur:** "Light motion blur for realism"
- **Maintain style:** "Keep the aesthetic and colors exactly as in the input image"

### Troubleshooting:
- **If style doesn't match reference:** Re-upload reference and emphasize "exact style match"
- **If wrong products appear:** List products explicitly with detailed descriptions
- **If colors are wrong:** Provide hex codes again and say "use ONLY these specific colors"
- **If composition is off:** Describe camera angle more specifically ("overhead 45-degree angle")
- **If quality is low:** Request "ultra-detailed, photorealistic, 8K quality render"
