This document compares the d'you reference site with our proposed Lumore demo, highlights alignment points, and lists specific improvements to ensure our landing page is more premium and cohesive.

---

## 🚀 **DEMO-FIRST APPROACH**

**Priority Shift:** Building functional demo website ASAP using existing 46 assets.

### **Implementation Strategy:**

**✅ What We Have:**
- 7 transparent product images (perfect for CSS backgrounds)
- 3 hero images for carousel
- 7 testimonial images (static)
- 5 combo/ritual sets
- All supporting assets (blog, press, founder, models)

**🎯 Creative Solutions (No New Assets Needed):**

1. **Top Shelf Picks:** Use transparent products + CSS gradient backgrounds
   - Orange gradient for Solar Veil
   - Blue gradient for Dew Drops
   - Green gradient for Lumiskin
   - etc.
   - **Result:** Premium e-commerce cards without generating 7 cover photos

2. **Hero Section:** 3 static carousel images + placeholder for video
   - Use existing hero images in carousel
   - Add placeholder or static image for "New Release" video slot
   - **Result:** Functional hero carousel immediately

3. **Testimonials:** Static images in grid or carousel
   - Use existing 7 testimonial images
   - Add testimonial text as HTML/CSS overlay
   - **Result:** Effective social proof without video conversion

4. **Grab the Deals:** Animated placeholder or static product
   - Use existing product image with CSS animations
   - Add "Coming Soon" or placeholder for claw machine video
   - **Result:** Complete section ready for video enhancement later

5. **New Release:** Static product with placeholder for factory video
   - Use product image + static background
   - Add countdown timer and CTA
   - **Result:** Functional new release section

6. **Ingredient/Category Cards:** HTML/CSS/Framer Motion
   - Code-based hexagon designs
   - CSS gradients and animations
   - **Result:** No image generation needed

**🎯 Philosophy:** Demo first, enhance later. Get functional website live ASAP, iterate based on feedback, add videos/covers gradually.
