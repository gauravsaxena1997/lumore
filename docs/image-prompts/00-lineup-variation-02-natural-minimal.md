# Lumore Product Lineup - Variation 02: Natural Minimal Aesthetic

```
Create a wide horizontal product lineup photo showing all 7 Lumore skincare products arranged in a row on a soft natural surface with minimal organic elements.

BACKGROUND & SETTING:
- Soft cream/beige surface (#FAF8F5) - like smooth stone or matte ceramic
- Background: soft warm off-white (#FFFFF8) with very subtle texture
- Natural diffused lighting (like soft morning light through window)
- One or two MINIMAL natural elements for context:
  - Small dried pampas grass stem (off to one side, NOT blocking products)
  - OR small smooth stone/pebble (placed subtly near lineup)
  - Elements should be neutral tones and very minimal - don't compete with products
- Overall aesthetic: organic, natural, calm, spa-like

LIGHTING & SHADOWS:
- Soft natural window lighting from left side at 45-degree angle
- Creates gentle shadows extending to the right of each product
- Shadows are soft, natural, and organic (like real sunlight)
- Shadow color: warm gray-beige (#E8E6E0) - NOT black
- Shadow opacity: 25-35% (visible but gentle)
- Shadows slightly elongated to the right
- Soft feathered edges on all shadows

LAYOUT:
- Wide horizontal format (16:9 aspect ratio)
- All 7 products lined up in a single row from left to right
- Equal spacing between products (2-3cm gaps)
- All products standing on soft cream surface
- Natural element(s) placed to side or behind products (not blocking view)
