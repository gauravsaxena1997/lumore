# Lumore Product Lineup - Variation 01: Soft Pastel Gradient

```
Create a wide horizontal product lineup photo showing all 7 Lumore skincare products arranged in a row on a soft pastel gradient background.

BACKGROUND & LIGHTING:
- Soft vertical gradient background transitioning from pale blush pink (#FFF5F7) at top to soft sky blue (#F0F8FF) at bottom
- Very subtle, gentle gradient - barely noticeable, ethereal
- Soft diffused studio lighting from above and front
- SUBTLE soft shadows beneath each product (not harsh black shadows)
- Shadows should be soft gray/blue tinted, subtle, and natural
- Light creates gentle dimension without harsh contrasts
- Overall mood: dreamy, soft, premium, elegant

LAYOUT:
- Wide horizontal format (16:9 aspect ratio)
- All 7 products lined up in a single row from left to right
- Equal spacing between products (2-3cm gaps)
- All products standing on same surface level
- Soft shadows cast downward from each product

SHADOW SPECIFICATIONS:

- Shadow opacity: 20-30% (very subtle)
- Shadows should be slightly elongated toward camera (products lit from behind/above)
- Shadow edges should be very soft and feathered, not sharp
- Shadow size proportional to product base size
- Shadows add depth without being dramatic

RENDERING STYLE:
- Soft studio product photography aesthetic
- Products remain matte frosted finish (no reflections on products themselves)
- Gentle ambient lighting creates soft shadows
- Background gradient is very subtle and doesn't compete with products
- Overall feel: premium, soft, inviting, editorial
- 8K photorealistic quality
- Color accuracy maintained for all products
- Clean, elevated aesthetic

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Use the 7 reference images to match product colors exactly
- Products should look identical to individual renders
- Shadows are SOFT and SUBTLE - not dramatic or harsh
- Background gradient should enhance, not distract
- Maintain product visibility and color accuracy
- White caps/pumps remain clean and visible against soft background
