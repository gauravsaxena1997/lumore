```
Create a wide horizontal product lineup photo showing all 7 Lumore skincare products arranged in a row on a sleek modern surface with architectural geometric elements.

BACKGROUND & SETTING:
- Surface: smooth pale gray platform/pedestal (#F5F5F7) - modern, clean, architectural
- Background: soft gradient from light gray (#FCFCFD) at top to slightly darker cool gray (#F0F0F2) at bottom
- One subtle architectural element for depth:
  - Soft curved archway in background (very subtle, out of focus) in light cream color (#FDFDFB)
  - OR minimal geometric shapes (circles/arches) softly blurred in background
  - Elements create depth but don't compete with products
- Overall aesthetic: modern, minimalist, architectural, sophisticated

LIGHTING & SHADOWS:
- Soft directional studio lighting from upper right at 60-degree angle
- Creates defined but soft shadows extending to lower left of each product
- Shadows have structure but remain soft and elegant
- Shadow color: cool gray (#DFE1E5) with slight blue tint
- Shadow opacity: 30-40% (visible and structured but not harsh)
- Shadows slightly elongated diagonally (toward lower left)
- Soft gradient on shadow edges (defined but not sharp)
- Lighting creates modern, editorial feel
